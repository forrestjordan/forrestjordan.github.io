          Hello! My name is Forrest Jordan / Sasabuchi Shin. I am currently a second-year student at the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a B.S. in Creative Technology & Design within the College of Engineering & Applied Science.

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, where I lived until the age of 15. Growing up in such a vibrant, dynamic city has deeply influenced my perspective on design and technology, while navigating both Japanese and American cultures has given me a strong appreciation for global viewpoints.
