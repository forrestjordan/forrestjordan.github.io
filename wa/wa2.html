        My goal for this web this semester is to equip myself with the necessary skills to succeed<br>
        I was born and raised in <i>Tokyo, Japan,</i> and I moved to Colorado when I was 15 for High School and University<br>
        I am currently a 2nd year majoring in <i>Creative Technology & Design.</i><br>
