            <h2>Can I exchange or refund my ticket purchase?</h2><br>
            <h3><i>Refunds and Exchanges</i></h3>
            <p class="description-text">All sales are final. No refunds. Verify all information (title, date, time, seat selection, etc.) before purchasing tickets. Please Note: All ticket exchange requests must be made at least 24 hours before your scheduled performance. Requests made within 24 hours of or after your scheduled performance will not be eligible for on-account credit, exchange, or refund.</p>
            <p class="description-text">Subscribers may exchange tickets free of charge — one of the many subscriber benefits! Single-ticket holders may exchange for an additional fee ($5 per ticket). Exchanges can be made online, in person, or by phone for another performance within the same season, or you may receive on-account credit*. Additional costs apply if there are seating upgrades, and all exchange requests are subject to availability. You may also donate your tickets back to the Colorado Symphony and receive a donation receipt.</p>
            <p class="description-text"><em>*PLEASE NOTE:</em> All on-account credit from the 2024/25 Season must be used during the 2024/25 Season, ending with the season finale of Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto on May 30 – June 1, 2025. All unused on-account credit will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony at the completion of the 2024/25 Season.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How do I use my on-account credit?</h2><br>
            <h3><i>On-Account Credit</i></h3>
            <p class="description-text">If you received on-account credit for a ticket return or exchange, this credit may be used through the conclusion of the concert season in which it was given. Credit from the 2024/25 Season may only be used for concerts at Boettcher Concert Hall through June 1, 2025. After this date, all unused on-account credit will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony.</p>
            <p class="description-text">To use your credit towards a purchase, please contact the Box Office at (303) 623-7876. On-account credit cannot be used for online purchases.</p>
