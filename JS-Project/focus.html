        <h3>Academic</h3>
        <p>
          My academic journey has been driven by a passion for integrating creativity and technology to tackle complex challenges and craft meaningful user experiences. At the ATLAS Institute, I’ve concentrated on product design, computer vision, and UX/UI, participating in a wide array of academic projects that encourage creative problem-solving and technical approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In developing software and interactive systems, I primarily use Python and Arduino C++, while Adobe Creative Cloud and Ableton 12 are my go-to tools for multimedia work. To bring concepts to life and design engaging user experiences, I rely on SketchUp, Rhino, and Figma for 3D modeling and UX/UI design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities within software, consumer electronics, typography, and footwear technology.

        <h3>Life</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of the classroom, I am committed to community service and volunteering. I have launched several projects in Japan focused on fostering intercultural understanding among youth, and I’ve participated in international volunteer initiatives aimed at promoting cultural exchange, most recently in Qingdao, China.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my volunteer work, I co-founded JAM Data, a startup that provides a comprehensive data management solution for the skydiving industry. Our program streamlines everything from the waiver process to checkout, manifesting, video handling, and finances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatively, I enjoy exploring black-and-white photography, videography, and digital art, each offering a unique way to experiment with visual storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physical activity also plays a significant role in my life. I’m an avid cyclist, skier, climber, and basketball player, and I regularly train in muay thai.
